          For my 30th birthday ðŸŽ‚ my friend RocÃ­o took me to Rome, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ for the weekend. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We spent 3 days walking around the city. And visited the Coliseum, the Fontana di Trevi, the Roman Forum, and the Vatican from the outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a wonderful trip that I will never forget. Thank you baby ðŸ’•
